name: Security Scan - NexusOS Dependencies

# This workflow scans ONLY NexusOS-specific code and dependencies.
# Chromium security is handled by the Chromium team - we use their
# pre-built binaries which include all security patches.
#
# Scans:
# ✅ Python dependencies (pyproject.toml, uv.lock)
# ✅ NexusOS build system code
# ✅ Demo application dependencies
#
# Does NOT scan:
# ❌ Chromium source (not included in repo with binary download approach)
# ❌ Chromium binaries (handled by upstream Chromium security team)
