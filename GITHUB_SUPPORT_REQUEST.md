Subject: Request to Detach Fork - Rekonquest/BrowserOS-in-progress

Hello GitHub Support Team,

I am requesting to detach my repository from the fork network:

Repository: Rekonquest/BrowserOS-in-progress
Original fork source: browseros-ai/BrowserOS

Reason for request:
This repository has evolved into an independent project with significant
custom development. It is no longer intended to contribute back to the
upstream repository and should exist as a standalone project to avoid
confusion and maintain clear project identity.

Current situation:
- The repository contains substantial custom code and modifications
- Development direction has diverged from the original project
- This is a permanent, independent fork that will not be merged upstream
- Maintaining fork status creates confusion in workflows and references

Requested outcome:
Please detach this repository from the fork network while preserving:
- All git commit history
- All issues and pull requests
- All stars and watchers
- All repository metadata

Repository owner confirmation:
I am the owner of the repository Rekonquest/BrowserOS-in-progress and
confirm this request to detach it from the fork network.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
GitHub Username: Rekonquest
```
